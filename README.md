## Automate Block Diagram Evaluation System (ABDES) 

ABDES intended to evaluate block diagrams in answer papers.
Diagram evaluation is a major part of online answer script evaluation. A significant way for identifying and evaluating diagrams is by considering text present in blocks, semantics of the
text, arrow direction and shape of the blocks. In this work text present in blocks is evaluated using optical character recognition (OCR) technology, k means clustering and also text localization methods. Here OCR is used to extract text present in blocks, once extraction is over
evaluation is done by k means clustering. In this work is carried out as two phases training and evaluation. After text evaluation, direction of arrow is considered, which another
major part of a diagram evaluation. Arrow evaluation is done by contour detection algorithm. Based on Contour properties and k means clustering algorithm arrows present in diagram
detected and evaluated. For the shape identification also contour detection algorithm plays a major role.
